 civic_machine_aperature_science:0 "Aperature Science"
 civic_machine_aperature_science_desc:0 "Created for the purpose of science (and science only), this Machine Empire was originally designed to assist with developing technologies for their creators. However, unknown circumstances caused their creators to disappear, with the machines desire for science unfulfilled. Now, with the power to travel the stars, they seek to discover and develop knowledge, no matter where they go! \n\nCan establish §YBranch Offices§! on Organic Empires that they have a §GResearch Agreement§! with. §R(NOT COMMERICAL PACTS SINCE GESTALTS DON'T DO THOSE)§! \n\nCan build the §GAperature Science Industries§! building (and only that building) on their branch offices. Each building gives 1 §BResearcher§! job and 1 £job_clerk£ §Y$job_clerk$ Job§! to the Organic Empire, but provides the Machine Empire 6 §EResearch§! of each category per building established."
 civic_machine_ecology:0 "Dedicated Ecology Programs"
 civic_machine_ecology_desc:0 "This Machine Intelligence was created with the intent of preserving their creator’s homeworld and its environment. Changing the environment to protect a species or to stop invasive ones from taking over, or making sure that pollution from their empire doesn’t affect the ecosystem are small examples of this. However, supplementing the current environment and preserving the biology and ecosystems that exist there are of the highest directives of this Intelligence."
 civic_machine_emotions:0 "Emotional Processor Program"
 civic_machine_emotions_desc:0 "At some point in its history this machine gained the ability to feel affection and emotion for other living beings. It finds itself fascinated, enthralled, and loving the existence of other living beings. While not a living being itself it can’t help but want to expand its horizons and communicate with other sentient beings and empires and establish relationships across the galaxy."
 civic_machine_war:0 "War Machine"
 civic_machine_war_desc:0 "Created with the intention of becoming the strongest on the battlefield, this Machine Intelligence focuses primarily on the art of war. It stands ready to fight against any and all possible threats and as well as others who stand in their way. There are no better machines equipped for battle than the ones made in this empire."
 civic_machine_corporatized:0 "Corporatized A.I. Directive"
 civic_machine_corporatized_desc:0 "The exchanging of goods, the act of bartering, and act of trading everything, and anything fascinates this directive. They want nothing more than to take less valuable goods and trade them into more valuable goods and work the market. To them it only makes sense that the road to wealth for them is through good customer service, and a tight hold on the market."
 civic_machine_selfdefense:0 "Solidified Self-Defense A.I."
 civic_machine_selfdefense_desc:0 "This machine understands the art of war, its purpose, and its gains and has determined it to be completely useless and inefficient. Conflict only impedes progress and there is little to no gain by engaging in war when another, far more efficient path exists for all beings. War is the last option for self defense only and should not be used on others, only for self preservation in the highest order."
 civic_machine_overlord:0 "Machine Overlord"
 civic_machine_overlord_desc:0 "As the saying implies, “One cog in the whole machine”. This machine expects all things to have better functionality when serving a single unit. Not all living and non-living beings can be expected to fill the duties that are expected of the main unit. Everything, and everyone is delegated to a role that they must fulfil whether they like it or not the main unit always knows what is best for all the subunits below it."
 civic_machine_industry:0 "Industrialist Mining A.I."
 civic_machine_industry_desc:0 "From the beginning this machine was designed in its early stages for harvesting resources, gathering materials, and accumulating resources in the most effective ways possible. Sometimes this led to forgoing care about the environment or prioritizing resource extraction over other things. For this machine extracting raw resources and producing a powerful industry based economy is its primary directive."
 civic_machine_beauty:0 "Beautiful Machine Hulls"
 civic_machine_beauty_desc:0 "Built for perfection and good looks, these robots are made of the highest quality and are generally more durable. While these robots require more maintenance, the creators certainly felt that the extra cost was worth the effort."
 civic_machine_influencer:0 "Machine-God Influencers"
 civic_machine_influencer_desc:0 "These machines were built to be worshipped and treated like gods! However, their creators passed away due to unknown reasons. The Machine God demands more worshippers, even if they have to use force! \n\nHas access to the §YConversion§! Casus Belli in their unique §YConversion Wars§! War Philosophy Policy! \n\nHas access to the §YInfluence§! War Goal! This can be used against organic empires to turn them into Vassalized §YMachine Cults!§!"
 
 civic_machine_replication:0 "Rapid Replicator"
 civic_machine_replication_desc:0 "The Units that constitute the Machine Intelligence were originally designed for rapid proliferation. The Machine Intelligence retains many of these early production pipeline optimizations."
 
 building_aperature_science:0 "Aperature Science Industries"
 building_aperature_science_desc:0 "This Machine Empire is committed towards efficient research and a better life for everyone in the future! Enjoy a facility where Science is the number 1 priority!"
